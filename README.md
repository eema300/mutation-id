# MutationID: Gene Mutation Identifier

## Description

Mutation ID is a simple, user-friendly software for analyzing substitution, insertion, and deletion mutations in DNA sequences. It takes DNA sequence data in standard FASTA form, aligns and detects mutations, and returns a report identifying their positions and types.

## Usage
1. Load sequences from FASTA files
2. View sequences
3. Align sequences (option to export as `FASTA` or `.png`)
4. Highlight mutations (option to export as `.csv` or `.png`)
